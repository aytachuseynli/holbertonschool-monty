## Instructions
Push: This operation is used to add an element to the top of the stack. In a stack-based data structure, elements are added or removed from only one end, and the end where elements are added is referred to as the "top."

Pop: This operation is used to remove the element from the top of the stack. It essentially "pops" the top element off the stack.

Pall: This could be an abbreviation for "Print All." It might be a command to print all elements currently present in the stack.

Pint: This could be an abbreviation for "Print Integer." It might be a command to print the integer value of the element at the top of the stack.

Swap: This operation involves swapping the top two elements of the stack. It exchanges the positions of the element at the top of the stack with the one just below it.
